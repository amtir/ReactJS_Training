package.json 
> Entry point to the app
> All the packages install
> All the command (start, test, build)
> Meta Data (name, version, description)

Steps 1:
generate package.json
npm init
answer all questions
type yes

Step2: to install package
> npm i packageName / npm install packageName
ex: npm i axios 

node_modules > contains all the packages we have installed
package-lock.json > dependency tree , which package depends on what. (internally used by npm)

Local dependency 
> local to the folder 
can only be used in the same application 
for each application we need to install again 

Global dependency 
Install in your laptop
need admin permission to install
only used before app start/generate the app


Windows 
(one time)
Open cmd as administrator 
npm i -g -create-react-app
close cmd

for evert app 
open cmd 
go insde the folder where you want app
create-react-app appname

React is a Javascript library which help to build single page application using component based structure 

Questions
Library vs Framework ? 

React 2015, 2016 10 years back 
script tags , to import library   

Angular is Framework, heavier. 

Single page
Header, Footer Structure 
Home, About, Content pages 
Only the necessary component parts are updated  

Concept the Virtual Dom 
Reconciliation algorithm 
=> In-Memory-DOM is compared with the loaded DOM and replace only the difference. 

SPA  Single Page Application 
Only the content is updated 

Return only one element
1 Empty tag
2 React.Fragment
3 Fragment 
import React, {Fragment} from 'react'


////////////////////////////

Read about the JavaScript methods
.map
.filter

state  
> act as a local variable
Every variable will have its own state
could be updated 
and with every state change -> components will re-render 
Any Data interaction will happen through state

props 
> is use to share data between components
we can only share data between nested component

class Component (No more used by companies)
> logical 
> all logic api calling, state, handle events

functional Component
> dumb component
> display

hooks ( functional component)
>

Summary
Class Components: Becoming less relevant due to verbosity and complexity.
Functional Components with Hooks: Modern, simple, and powerful, allowing state and side-effect management without lifecycle complexities.
Industry Trend: Companies and developers are overwhelmingly adopting functional components, making React development more intuitive and efficient.
